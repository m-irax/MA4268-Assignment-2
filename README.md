# MA4268-Assignment-2


Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and its inversion are one essential transform in digital image processing. The goal of this project is to implement two-dimensional Haar-wavelet-based DWT and its inverse DWT for 2D images, either in Matlab or Python. 

## Remarks
The following assumption is allowed in the implementation: We can assume that the image is always of size 2N × 2N, N is an integer. We may NOT call any code on discrete wavelet transform or inverse wavelet transform of existing packages. However, we are allowed to call the routines ”conv”, ”conv2” or similar functions in numpy or scipy.
